When you've created your feeded, selected the products to be added and saved the feed all you need to do is view the feed in the browser window (Click 'View Feed') and copy the Feed URL. You can then enter this URL within your Google Merchant Account. Google will then read the Feed at regular intervals. Any changes you make to the feed will be reflected in your Google Merchant Account the next time Google reads your feed.
